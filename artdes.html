                    <h2> <em> 01 lesions </em> (2025)</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> this piece was made with prismacolor colored pencils and white ink</li>
                        <li> with this large-scale (11x14) piece, i wanted to explore themes of surpression,
                            particularly when one begins to put up a mask or a front, and watches as it begins to
                            shatter. i think there is a
                            lot to say when it comes to hiding parts of oneself, as we may be doing it explicitly or
                            implicitly, yet you can feel the weight of it regardless.</li>
                        <li> the first detail shot is of the hand, which i spent a considerable amount of time on to
                            really show the stress and grip the hand has on the arm, a depction of stress. i also really
                            wanted to take time to
                            draw out the light from the fireworks softly shining on it, a little study of the intricacy
                            of light in illustration.</li>
                        <li> the second detail shot is of the fireworks and its bright, primary colors. the brightness
                            of the sparkles and light emission was intended to be focal and almost distracting. the
                            fireworks were intended to distract the viewer from the stress and agony of the subject. i
                            drew the fireworks somewhat aggressively to contrast the softness of the subject, but
                            aggression of this breaking "feeling".
                        </li>

                    <h2> <em> 02 fourteenth street station </em> (2024)</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> this piece was made with prismacolor colored pencils and white ink</li>
                        <li> my one true love in this world is my home city, new york city. this piece is an ode to the
                            everyday that i feel grateful to have. from talking to strangers, to the feeling of being
                            alone in a crowded train, my home is unlike any other place, both in a positive and negative
                            way. being drawn to a place doesn’t mean loving it 24/7, but it does mean you can’t imagine
                            yourself away for too long.
                        </li>
                        <li> my first detail shot is of the older couple on the far left of the bench. i felt that these
                            two people had the most character and importance as subjects, mainly due to their pose and
                            clothing choice. it felt very comfortable and ordinary, a theme i wanted to be present in
                            this piece.
                        </li>
                        <li> the second detail shot captures the more greyscale side of the landscape. you can see the
                            contrast in the blurred ceilings and subway car itself and the more sharp angles of the
                            signs surrounding it.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li> this piece was made with colored pencil and ink</li>
                        <li> a quick note on the title: yes, the irony is that almost the entire piece is in cool toned colors. but, the focal point is of course the smaller, warm-toned firefly (which has connotations of heat, life, and fire). the piece is, by nature, avant garde, so i thought the title needed an element of oddity as well  </li>
                        <li>  the first detail shot is the poor, unmoving firefly in the woman’s mouth. i do think the firefly could have used extra details and work, however i thought it was important to include as a detail. it is somewhat uncomfortable and cruel. </li>
                        <li> the second shot is a shot of the neck and collarbone, my favorite technical aspect of this piece. i really wanted to hone in on skin, muscle, and the human body in general, especially in a bright color.

                    <ul>
                        <li> this piece was made with alcohol markers, colored pencils, white ink, black ink, and
                            graphite.k</li>
                        <li> this was my very first mixed media piece, which i created in a moment of feeling
                            overwhelmed (not necessarily with blame, but overall). this is also the first piece i made
                            with words, especially using calligraphy and other word art methods. </li>
                        <li> i caputred the multicolored hand, face, and background with my first detail shot. this
                            piece was meant to make people anxious and overwhelmed the more you look at it, hence the
                            intentional use of multiple colors, materials, and styles. </li>
                        <li> the second shot gets the more technical part of the piece, which are the four graphite
                            hands. at the time of making the piece, i didn’t know if i wanted the “blame” being placed
                            on the subject was supposed to be from other people, or from themselves internally. it is up
                            for interpretation, even if the hands can be indicative of external pressure and blame.

                        <li> the title says it all! this piece is acryllic paint on fabric (polyster)</li>
                        <li> if you love spiderman: into the spiderverse, this design may be familliar! this is the 
                            exact graffiti that miles and aaron do in the subway in the former half of the movie </li>
                        <li> i thought this was a great motif and overall a powerful piece of art that i wanted to
                            mimic for my graduation cap. graduation was a step tatoward the real world and towards
                        a version of me that i wanted to represent, all without constraints and pressure. </li>
                        <li> it also helps that i am very into street art and graffiti as an art style and as a movement, which made this
                            piece all the more special. a homage to my favorite art style, one of my favorite movies, and a congratulations to myself on graduation!
