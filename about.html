            hello, it's aashi again :)
            <br>
            <br>

            i am so so happy that you found my little corner of the internet and that you stuck around to read my about
            page!
            <br>
            <br>

            i spent a lot of time hand crafting every element of this page. i really think i grew as a programmer, as a
            designer, and definitely as an artist. there's something truly special about taking the time to hand craft
            everything with intention, and creating a design that makes people smile.
            <br>
            <br>

            that being said, and despite my love for this first design, i am in
            progress of redesigning the site to showcase myself further, communicate my technical skills, and make my
            site more accessible so that everyone can navigate my site without issues. this is not a decison i took lightly, but i am confident 
            that i'll still be able to show the fun and whimsical side of myself.
            <br>
            <br>
            if you've read through this, thank you :) your support, even something as easy as reading my site, means the world to me. 
            <br>
            <br>
